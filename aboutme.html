<p> Born in South Carolina, pruned in Texas, now soaking up the sun in Los Angeles - My passion is for understanding others and empowering them to live their best lives. Understanding mental health is something I take very seriously and I try to incorporate it in everything I do, whether that is learning, exercising, or building community. In my free time, I like taking long walks and considering them runs, reading books about owning my feminist badassery, and going down Youtube wormholes of quintessential Americans like Monica Lewinski and Britney Spears. I have eaten more tacos than you. </p>
