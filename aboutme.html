<p> Born in South Carolina, pruned in Texas, now soaking up the sun in Los Angeles - My passion is for understanding others and empowering them to live their best lives. Understanding mental health is something I take very seriously and I try to incorporate it in everything I do, whether that is learning, exercising, or building community. In my free time, I like taking long walks and considering them runs, reading books about owning my feminist badassery, and going down Youtube wormholes of quintessential Americans like Monica Lewinski and Britney Spears. In the future, I hope to use my strengths to help empower women and minorities to take back their place in the tech world. In the meantime, find me in my happy place: studying my booty off with a breakfast burrito in hand! </p>
